(Development period: November 2024 - March 2025)
I made this game with a few friends to prototype the idea of a 2vs2 PvP Puyo-puyo like game where two teams compete against one another! 
The twist is that on each team, one player plays the brick/puzzle game and the other attacks the other player's board to hinder them and try to outlast them!
